# Evolution
- Evolution is just like any other optimization algorithm.
- It is used to find local minimums in a phase space, assuming the phase space is smooth.


- Gradient descent assumes that the phase space is smooth, but there are many problems which don't have smooth phase spaces.
	- Problems that only have a few defined solutions. Ex: Reversing the game of life.


- Evolution is an algorithm used to find local optimizations to a problem.
- For example, imagine you have a function on a graph.
- This function has hills and valleys.
- The lower Y value, the better the optimization for the problem.
- The X value is the input.
- Imagine you pick a random X value on this function and it lands on the top of a hill.
- In evolution





		What is evolution?
			Evolution is an algorithm to find a local optimization for a given problem.

			1. Initialise the groups of variables. Usually with some element of randomness.
				The groups of variables are individual people and their variables are stored in their DNA.
			2. Calculate which groups of variables reproduce or not. This calculation depends upon the variables within the group.
				The odds of reproducing are partially determined by a person's DNA and competition with other people.
			3. Add randomness to the groups of variables that have been selected. This randomness can be a variable.
				Mutations within the DNA are random. Some species may allow for more mutations than others.



- What is evolution
- The limitations of evolution
	- If the valley lies on a hill and the opening is narrow enough, then it's practically impossible for evolution to find that solution.
		- Ex: Wheel and axels

- I am defining life as a turning complete organism that follows the evolutionary algorithm.
- I am defining intelligent life as just a very optimized form of this life. There isn't a clear line between intelligent life.
- Can there be a organism that isn't bound by the limitations of evolutions and has become more optimized then intelligent life. Is there a super intelligent general artificial life(SIGAL) that is no longer bound by the limitations of the evolutionary algorithm?

- Intelligent life is defined as life that has the ability to think at higher dimensions in order to create local optimizations that cannot be reached by the evolutionary algorithm.
	- Needs a simulation fo teh world
- Artificial intelligent life is defined as a life form that hasn't come from the evolutionary algorithm, but has the ability to create local optimizations that cannot be reached by the evolutionary algorithm.

- Only when you go into higher dimensions, such as logical thought, does a wheel and axel become something that can be gotten through gradual understanding. You have a problem discovered from a simulation fo the world, then you find a solution/local minima to the problem.
	- Is this true? Can logical thought be gradual enough to make the idea of a wheel and axel seem natural?
	- Only once you go into higher dimension, such as logical thought, does the valley in which a wheel and axel is found within become a much larger valley to where evolution could still work. So that through gradual reasoning to the next local minima could you reach the conclusion of a wheel and axel. This is like you had a way to jump between the local minima in a lower dimension and somehow connect the,. This is the power of logical thought.
		- Ex: You have a problem where you want to move a big rock.
		- We need an external simulation of the world, where you could find problems with a solution. Rapid iteration of testing solutions.

## Questions
- Why did life use the evolutionary algorithm over another algorithm?
	- maybe because that was the only algorithm that could work with the constraints of life?
		- if so, what are these constraints?
