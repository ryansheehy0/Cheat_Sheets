- `#`s can also be used instead of the `/`s

```

```

## [awk](#linux-commands)
Awk is used to run a command on inputs that are separated by some pattern. The default field separator is a space. It can also be used to run commands on each line of a file.

Columns are defined with teh field separator. Rows are defined by new lines.

`$#` is used to choose which column. `$NF` is used to get the last column.

| Flags | Description                               |
|-------|-------------------------------------------|
| -F':' | Setting a custom field separator to be :s |

Examples:
- `awk '{print $2}' /inputFile.txt`
  - Prints the the 2nd column from inputFile
- `awk '{print $1,$NF}' /inputFile.txt`
  - Prints the the 1st column and the last column from inputFile
- `echo "[" && awk '{print "\""$1"\""","}' ./text.txt && echo "]" > text.json`
  - Converts a text file of lines of data into an array in a json file

## [Networking](#linux-commands)

### [ping](#linux-commands)
Ping is used to message a server and see if you are getting a response.

| Flags | Description                                   |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------|
| -c #  | Stops ping after a certain number of requests |

- You can use ip `8.8.8.8` which is google's dns server to check if you have an internet connection.
- Ping uses ICMP network requests and some servers maybe configured to block this traffic.

### [httprobe](#linux-commands)
httprobe is used to take a list of domains and probe for working HTTP and HTTPS servers.

`cat domains.txt | httprobe > results.txt`

### [curl](#linux-commands)
Used to get the return information from websites/apis. Makes a get request form a URL.

`curl https://api.github.com/users`

| Flags   | Description                                |
|---------|--------------------------------------------|
| -i      | Returns the headers and content            |
| -I      | Returns just the headers                   |
| -X HTTP | Used to make http commands other than GET. |

## [grep](#linux-commands)
Grep is used for searching text in a file. Grep returns the lines that match a pattern, or the files that contain the pattern.

`grep -Flags pattern fileName`

| Flags | Description                                                                    |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -w    | Just match the word and not words which just contain the pattern               |
| -i    | Case sensitive                                                                 |
| -n    | Gives line number                                                              |
| -A #  | Shows # of lines after the line which has the pattern                          |
| -B #  | Shows # of lines before the line which has the pattern                         |
| -C #  | Shows # of lines before and after the line which has the pattern               |
| -r    | Recursively search through a directory                                         |
| -l    | Just show the files which contain the match                                    |
| -c    | Shows all files and how many matches are in that file.                         |
| -P    | Allows for Pearl compatible expressions. Allows \d and other regex expressions |
| -v    | Inverse match                                                                  |
| -h    | Don't display the file name. Just the lines                                    |
| -H    | Display the file name and the lines.                                           |

If you don't want to recursively search through a directory you can do `grep pattern dirPath/*`

Examples:
- `grep -wirn "grep" .` Searches for lines with the word "grep" recursively in the current directory
- `grep -wirl "grep" .` Searches for files that contain the word "grep"
- `grep -wirc "grep" . | grep -v :0$` Search for files that contain the word "grep" and how many matches they have to the word "grep"

## [sort and uniq](#linux-commands)
`sort` is used to sort an input by alphabetical order or numerical order.

| Flags | Description                |
|-------|----------------------------|
| -u    | Only outputs unique values |
| -n    | Numerical search           |
| -r    | Reverse sort               |

`uniq` omits repeated lines. By default uniq removes adjacent duplicated values.

| Flags | Description                                   |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------|
| -d    | Only print out the lines which has duplicates |
| -u    | Only displays lines which aren't duplicated   |
| -c    | Gives a count                                 |

uniq is often used with sort. Sort groups the same lines together and uniq removes duplicated lines.

Example:
`sort favFlavors.txt | uniq -c | sort -nr` Gets the favorite flavors from most popular to least

## [head and tail](#linux-commands)
`head` and `tail` are used to output on the first or last lines of a file.

| Flags | Description                         |
|-------|-------------------------------------|
| -n #  | Number of lines. The default is 10. |

## [Redirection operations](#linux-commands)

| Command           | Description                                                                               |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| command \> file   | Redirect the output of a command into another file. It overwrites everything in that file |
| command \>\> file | Append to the end of a file                                                               |
| command \< file   | Inputs the file into the command. You can also use `cat file \| command`                  |

- `<<` is used to input blocks of text into a command
  - The delimiter is any sequence of characters which marks the end of the input block
```bash
# This will input the lines "Input line 1." and "Input line 2." into the command and the command will treat it as an input file.
command << delimiter
Input line 1.
Input line 2.
delimiter
```

- You can run this to append to the beginning of a file
```bash
echo "Append to beginning" | cat - file.txt > temp && mv temp file.txt
```

## [alias](#linux-commands)
alias is used to create shortcuts to commands so you don't have to always type them out.

| Commands                   | Description                                                                                  |

| alias aliasName='commands' | Create an alias. To have them persist across terminal instances put them in the .bashrc file |
