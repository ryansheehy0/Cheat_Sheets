Unit is being defined as whatever the smallest unit is in the universe.

In order to observe something you have to interfere with it.

When you interfere with a Unit you can only know a percentage of its momentum and/or position. This percentage is calculated from a collapse in the superposition of that Unit.

All the energy in the universe has a force pushing it to become less dense. The universe is an optimization algorithms that decreases its energy density.
  - Like a ball in a valley. It might not be at its lowest point so you would need to supplied more energy to get it over another hill and travel to an even lower point.
  - Maybe all the other forces stem back in some way to this one force.

What exactly is interference between Units?
  If 2 or more Units give their energy to one another.

Can you have a collections of Units which don't interfere?
  Yes. Atoms and Bucky-Balls(collection of 60 carbon atoms) have quantum effects.

How large can you have a collection of Units that have a superposition?
  How large can you have a collection of Units that don't share energy?
