# How A CPU Works
- Notes from [Ben Eater's youtube series on building an 8-bit computer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU).

- A **word** is fixed size of data that a computer can process in a single operation.
- The **base of a computer** is the amount of bits a word is for that computer.
	- Today, the most common is base 64 where a word is 64 bits.
	- `X`s on any diagram represent the amount of connections equal to the base of the computer.
		- For example, in an 8-bit computer X represents 8 connections, or in a 64-bit computer X represents 64 connections.

## [Clock Signal](#how-a-cpu-works)
The clock signal is like the heart beat of the computer. It is a repeating pattern of high and low voltage which is used across the CPU in order to sync the execution of different components.
- Today clock signals are usually generated by a quartz crystal.
- They can also be constructed using a 555 timer as seen from Ben Eater's videos.

- The HLT signal is used to stop the clock.

## [Logic Gates](#how-a-cpu-works)
Logic gates are used to perform the logic within the computer. Modules are constructed from many of these logic gates in order to perform specialized operations.
- Everything other than the clock signal can be constructed by logic gates in a computer.

| Selective input gates | <img src="selective_input_gates.jpeg" width="500"> |

### [Logic Gates from Transistors](#how-a-cpu-works)
Logic gates can be created from transitions/digital switches. The most commonly used transistors are MOSFETS.

|                      |                                   |                    |                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| NMOS(1 On and 0 Off) | <img src="nmos.jpeg" width="100"> | PMOS(0 On and 1 Off) | <img src="pmos.jpeg" width="100"> |

|     |                                       |      |                                        | | |
|-----|---------------------------------------|------|----------------------------------------|-|-|
| NOT | <img src="not_gate.jpeg" width="100"> | NAND | <img src="nand_gate.jpeg" width="100"> | NOR | <img src="nor_gate.jpeg" width="100"> |


- NAND or NOR gates can be used to construct any other logic gate.
	- Ex: XOR

<img src="xor_gate.jpeg" width="200">

## [SR Latch](#how-a-cpu-works)
Once the SR Latch is set to 1 or 0 it maintains its state, unlike logic gates.
- Set(S) is used to latch the output(Q) to 1.
- Reset(R) is used to latch the output(Q) to 0.

| S | R | Q | !Q |
|---|---|---|----|
| 0 | 0 | Q | !Q |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1  |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0  |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0  |

|                                           |                                           |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|

## [D Latch and D Flip-Flop](#how-a-cpu-works)

### [D Latch](#how-a-cpu-works)
The D latch is a modification to the SR latch to allow for one input(D) to set and reset it. This input(D) only works when the enable pin(EN) is set.

| EN | D   | Q | !Q |
|----|-----|---|----|
| 0  | 0/1 | Q | !Q |
| 1  | 0   | 0 | 1  |
| 1  | 1   | 1 | 0  |

<img src="d_latch.jpeg" width="350" >

### [D Flip-Flop](#how-a-cpu-works)
The D Flip-Flop is like the D Latch, but only activates when the clock signal goes from low to high.
- They can be used to store 1 bit of information

|                                           |                                                  |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| <img src="d_flip_flop.jpeg" width="350" > | <img src="d_flip_flop_symbol.jpeg" width="150" > |

#### [Edge detectors](#how-a-cpu-works)
In order to detect when the clock goes from low to high, you need an edge detection circuit.

<img src="edge_detection.jpeg" width="350" >

1. A NOT gate can have a slight delay which can be used to create a pulse when the clock signal goes from low to high.

<img src="not_and_edge_detection.jpeg" width="350" >

- You may need to use multiple NOT gates in series in order to create a significant enough delay.

2. Capacitor, resistor, and diode

<img src="cap_res_diode_edge_detection.jpeg" width="250" >

## [Bus](#how-a-cpu-works)
A bus is used for communication between different modules of a CPU. It is a collection of wires, usually the same number as the base of the computer, which connects to all other modules.

<img src="bus.jpeg" width="700" >

- A module can either put data onto the bus(Enable), read memory from the bus(Load), or neither.

| Enable | Load | Description            |
|--------|------|------------------------|
| 0      | 0    | Neither/Floating       |
| 1      | 0    | Put data onto the bus  |
| 0      | 1    | Read data from the bus |
| 1      | 1    | Never used             |

- When one module puts data onto the bus and the other reads data from the bus, that module passed information to the other module.
- The CLK signal are shared between each module to allow them to be synced

### [Floating output](#how-a-cpu-works)
In order to have a floating output(not set to 1 or 0) you need to decouple it from the bus.
- These are called tri-state gates

| In | En | Out           |
|----|----|---------------|
| 0  | 0  | Hi-Z/Floating |
| 1  | 0  | Hi-Z/Floating |
| 0  | 1  | 0             |
| 1  | 1  | 1             |

|                                              |                                              | |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-|
| <img src="tri_state_gate.jpeg" width="250" > | <img src="tri_state_symbol.jpeg" width="250" > | <img src="tri_state_gates.jpeg" width="250" > |

## [Register](#how-a-cpu-works)
A register is a module that is used to to store a word, same bits as the computer base, of memory inside the CPU.
- The D Flip-Flop is used to store one bit of information

|                                            |                                                   |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| <img src="register_bit.jpeg" width="250" > | <img src="register_bit_symbol.jpeg" width="250" > |

## [Arithmetic logic unit(ALU)](#how-a-cpu-works)
The arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is the module in the CPU which does mathematical and logical operations. It is connected to registers and can transfer the results to the bus.

<img src="alu_overview.jpeg" width="350" >

| Input | Description           |
|-------|-----------------------|
| AI    | A register In/Load    |
| AO    | A register Out/Enable |
| EO    | Sum Out/Enable        |
| SU    | Subtract              |
| BI    | B register In/Load    |
| BO    | B register Out/Enable |

- The X symbolizes the amount of connections equal to the base of the computer.

### [Twos complement](#how-a-cpu-works)
Twos complement is a protocol for converting binary numbers to base 10 numbers. This protocol allows for binary addition and subtraction to translate into base 10 addition and subtraction.
- If the leading bit is 1 then it's negative and if it's 0 it's positive.

| Binary | Base 10 | Binary | Base 10 |
|--------|---------|--------|---------|
| 1000   | -8      | 0000   | 0       |
| 1001   | -7      | 0001   | 1       |
| 1010   | -6      | 0010   | 2       |
| 1011   | -5      | 0011   | 3       |
| 1100   | -4      | 0100   | 4       |
| 1101   | -3      | 0101   | 5       |
| 1110   | -2      | 0110   | 6       |
| 1111   | -1      | 0111   | 7       |

- Ex calculation:

```
  -5  ->   1011
+  5  -> + 0101
-----    -------
   0  <-  10000

  -7  ->   1001
+  2  -> + 0010
-----    -------
  -5  <-   1011
```

To convert a number between negative and positive(and vise versa) in two's complement, you first invert all the bits and then add 1.

```
-7  ->  1001   Convert to binary
1001 -> 0110   Invert/Flip bits
0110 -> 0111   Binary Add 1
0111  -> 7     Convert to decimal
```

### [Full adder](#how-a-cpu-works)
A full adder is used to add two bits together. The Carry In(CI) input is used to allow for the inclusion of a carry bit from another addition. The Carry Out(CO) output is set to 1 when the addition results in a carry output and 0 when it's not.

|                                                |                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| <img src="full_adder_gates.jpeg" width="350" > | <img src="full_adder_symbol.jpeg" width="350" > |

### [Adder and Subtractor](#how-a-cpu-works)
Full adders are strung together to do addition on the full word of a computer.

- 4-bit computer adder example:

<img src="4_bit_adder.jpeg" width="350" >

- In order to subtract(SU to 1) with the 2s compliment then you have to invert, which is done with the XORs, and then add one, which is done by connecting to the carry in(CI) input to the adder.
