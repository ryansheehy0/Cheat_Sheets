1. Change "none" to your branch you want ot deploy from
1. Change "/(root)" to "/docs"
1. Click "Save" and wait. It may take a while
  - Any new pushes to that branch should be automatically deployed
  - If any new changes are taking a very long time to deploy then you need to create a new repo with your code and deploy from that.
