| rax           | 64 bits                                 |

| Register name | Description         |
|---------------|---------------------|
| rax           | Primary accumulator |
| rbx           | Base register       |

## Commands
Commands follow this syntax: cmd des, src
- The source(src) goes into the destination(des).
- The sources and destinations can either be a register, a memory address, or an immediate number/string.
	- All immediate values are limited to 32 bits.
	- If you have a negative immediate value, the sign is extended to the end of the 64 bits.

### Moving and conditional codes

|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| mov des, src    | Copies the value form source to destination. Dereferences pointers.         |
| lea des, src    | Copies the value form source to destination. Doesn't dereferences pointers. |
| cmovCC des, src | Conditional move. cc is the conditional code.                               |

## Sections and Start

| Sections | Description                                                                             |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| .data    | Used to declare global variables with values. Initialized values are in the executable. |
| .bss     | Used to declare global variable with 0s. It doesn't store 0 in the executable.          |
| .text    | Contains the executable instruction of the program.                                     |

- .bss is used to save 0s from being in the executable.

```assembly
section .text
	global _start

_start:
	; Your code goes here
	; Syscall exit
	mov rax, 60
	xor rdi, rdi ; Exit code 0
	syscall
```

## Variables
Variables take the form of: varName varSize immValue/?
- The s in front means it's signed.
- Immediate floats need to have decimal points. Ex: 10.0

| varSize         | Description            |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| byte/db/sbyte   | 8 bits                 |
| word/dw/sword   | 16 bits                |
| dword/dd/sdword | 32 bits                |
| qword/dq/sqword | 64 bits                |
| real4           | 32 floating point bits |
| real8           | 64 floating point bits |

### Arrays
- You can create arrays with a repeated patter using `times`.
	- Ex: `arrName times 5 db 0` creates an array of 5 bytes all initialized to 0.
- You can create arrays by listing out each element.
	- Ex: `arrName db 1, 2, 3, 4`
- You can use quotes(`"`s) to create arrays.
	- Ex: `str db "Hello, World!", 0xA`
- You can get teh size of an array using `equ`
	- Ex: `arrSize equ $ - arrName`

## Pointers

|                       | Description                                                             |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `var`                 | Gets the value of var                                                   |
| `[ptr]`               | Dereferences the pointer                                                |
| `[reg/mem +/- # * #]` | The `* #` is the bytes of each array element. The `+/- #` is the index. |

- If you want to get the address of var, then use the lea command.

## Hello World

```assembly
section .data
	msg db "Hello, world!", 0xA   ; Message with newline
	len equ $ - msg               ; Calculate length of the message

section .text
	global _start                 ; Entry point for the program

_start:
	; Syscall write
	mov rax, 1                    ; System call number for write
	mov rdi, 1                    ; File descriptor 1 (stdout)
	mov rsi, msg                  ; Address of the message
	mov rdx, len                  ; Length of the message
	syscall                       ; Invoke the system call

	; Syscall exit
	mov rax, 60                   ; System call number for exit
	xor rdi, rdi                  ; Exit code 0
	syscall                       ; Invoke the system call
```
