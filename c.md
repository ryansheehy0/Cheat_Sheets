## Data
### Data Types
### Compound Data Types
#### Structs
Structs allow you to group together variables of different types in to a single unit and each variable takes up its own memory space.
#### Unions
Unions allow a single variable to hold different types with only one member active at a time. All members in a union share the same memory space and assigning a value to one member overwrites the values of the other members. The size of the union is the size of the largest member.
#### Enums
#### Arrays
