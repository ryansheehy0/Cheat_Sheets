	- There are certain problems that are so difficult that you can't create an algorithm to solve them, you can only create an algorithm that can create an algorithm to solve the problem.
	- How do you know if a problem is too complex that you cannot create a relatively simple algorithm to solve it? Are these NP problems?

    - Incremental changes get you closer and closer to the solution
    - The hill might not be tall enough to solve the problem
    - Randomness might take you away from the local maxima
        - What if you increasingly add more and more randomness, until you jump to a new local maxima?
            - The only solution is to guess and check. Like solving a hash.

- You're given a large sequence of data. Data correlated with a score. Use AI to make a patter between the input data and the score. And have that AI tell you which parts of the data are needed to produce a good score.
    - How could you get the knowledge from the AI?
- Object classification
    - And gaining other info about the object

Algorithms
- Memory managed hash table
    - Arrays are slow to retrieve data(high computations), but take up only the memory that is needed(low memory).
    - Hash tables are fast at retrieving data(low computations), but take up a lot of memory to allow all possible states of the hash output(high memory).
    - What if you could put the data in an array(low memory) and encode the position of that data in an equation. Then when retrieving the data you just have to run the equation(low computations) to get the exact position.
